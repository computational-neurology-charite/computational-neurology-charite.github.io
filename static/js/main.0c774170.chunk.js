This wealth of information is stored in centralized data warehouses, creating a rich resource for clinical insights. However, the sheer volume and complexity of this data can overwhelm traditional analysis methods. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, our team aims to transform these raw datasets into actionable intelligence, improving the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of diagnostic processes. Our work focuses on automating the analysis of biosignals and other clinical data to enhance real-time decision-making, reduce the burden on healthcare professionals, and streamline hospital workflows. By seamlessly integrating AI models into clinical environments, we seek to drive innovation in patient care, ultimately improving outcomes and paving the way for a more data-driven healthcare future.

Through motus med, we apply several vision based AI models that we have developed in the lab.

Physics and information theory have provided a framework describing an optimal state of information processing. This critical state, poised at the phase transition between chaotic and ceasing neuronal activity, is characterized by an equilibrium between excitation and inhibition in the neuronal network. When a network of neurons operates near a critical phase transition point, a range of information processing functions, including information transmission, integration, storage, dynamic range, and sensitivity to inputs, are optimized simultaneously. While criticality provides a precise framework linking network structure to dynamics, its central claim, that critical dynamics predicts optimal network and thus cognitive function in humans, has not been proven yet.
