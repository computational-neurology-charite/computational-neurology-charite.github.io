	abstract = {Patient-generated health data provide a great opportunity for more detailed ambulatory monitoring and more personalized treatments in many diseases. In epilepsy, robust diagnostics applicable to the ambulatory setting are needed as diagnosis and treatment decisions in current clinical practice are primarily reliant on patient self-reports, which are often inaccurate. Recent work using wearable devices has focused on methods to detect and forecast epileptic seizures. Whether wearable device signals may also contain information about the effect of antiseizure medications (ASMs), which may ultimately help to better monitor their efficacy, has not been evaluated yet. Here we systematically investigated the effect of ASMs on different data modalities (electrodermal activity, EDA, heart rate, HR, and heart rate variability, HRV) simultaneously recorded by a wearable device in 48 patients with epilepsy over several days in the epilepsy long-term monitoring unit at a tertiary hospital. All signals exhibited characteristic diurnal variations. HRV, but not HR or EDA-based metrics, were reduced by ASMs. By assessing multiple signals related to the autonomic nervous system simultaneously, our results provide novel insights into the effects of ASMs on the sympathetic and parasympathetic interplay in the setting of epilepsy and indicate the potential of easy-to-wear wearable devices for monitoring ASM action. Future work using longer data may investigate these metrics on multidien cycles and their utility for detecting seizures, assessing seizure risk, or informing treatment interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective: Objective seizure count estimates are crucial for ambulatory epilepsy management. Wearables have shown promise for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures but may suffer from false alarms and undetected seizures. Seizure signatures recorded by wearables often occur over prolonged periods, including increased levels of electrodermal activity and heart rate long after seizure EEG onset, however, previous detection methods only partially exploited these signatures. Understanding the utility of these prolonged signatures for seizure count estimation and what factors generally determine seizure logging performance, including the role of data quality vs. algorithm performance, is thus crucial for improving wearables-based epilepsy monitoring and determining which patients benefit most from this technology.

Methods: In this retrospective study we examined 76 pediatric epilepsy patients during multiday video-EEG monitoring equipped with a wearable (Empatica E4; records of electrodermal activity, EDA, accelerometry, ACC, heart rate, HR; 1983 h total recording time; 45 tonic-clonic seizures). To log seizures on prolonged data trends, we applied deep learning on continuous overlapping 1-hour segments of multimodal data in a leave-one-subject-out approach. We systematically examined factors influencing logging performance, including patient age, antiseizure medication (ASM) load, seizure type and duration, and data artifacts. To gain insights into algorithm function and feature importance we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP, to represent the separability of learned features) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP, to represent the most informative data signatures).

Results: Performance for tonic-clonic seizure logging increased systematically with patient age (AUC 0.61 for patients 〈 11 years, AUC 0.77 for patients between 11-15 years, AUC 0.85 for patients 〉 15 years). Across all ages, AUC was 0.75 corresponding to a sensitivity of 0.52 and a false alarm rate of 0.28/24 h. Seizures under high ASM load or with shorter duration were detected worse (P=.025, P=.033, respectively). UMAP visualized discriminatory power at the individual patient level, SHAP analyses identified clonic motor activity and peri/postictal increases in HR and EDA as most informative. In contrast, in missed seizures, these features were absent indicating that recording quality but not the algorithm caused the low sensitivity in these patients.

Significance: Our results demonstrate the utility of prolonged, postictal data segments for seizure logging, contribute to algorithm explainability and point to influencing factors, including high ASM dose and short seizure duration. Collectively, these results may help to identify patients who particularly benefit from such technology.},

	abstract = {Objective
              In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a taxonomy classifying patients into 3 cognitive phenotypes has been adopted: minimally, focally, or multidomain cognitively impaired (CI). We examined gray matter (GM) thickness patterns of cognitive phenotypes in drug‐resistant TLE and assessed potential use for predicting postsurgical cognitive outcomes.
            
            
              Methods
              
                TLE patients undergoing presurgical evaluation were categorized into cognitive phenotypes. Network edge weights and distances were calculated using type III analysis of variance
                F
                ‐statistics from comparisons of GM regions within each TLE cognitive phenotype and age‐ and sex‐matched healthy participants. In resected patients, logistic regression models (LRMs) based on network analysis results were used for prediction of postsurgical cognitive outcome.
              
            
            
              Results
              A total of 124 patients (63 females, mean age ± standard deviation [SD] = 36.0 ± 12.0 years) and 117 healthy controls (63 females, mean age ± SD = 36.1 ± 12.0 years) were analyzed. In the multidomain CI group (n = 66, 53.2\%), 28 GM regions were significantly thinner compared to healthy controls. Focally impaired patients (n = 37, 29.8\%) showed 13 regions, whereas minimally impaired patients (n = 21, 16.9\%) had 2 significantly thinner GM regions. Regions affected in both multidomain and focally impaired patients included the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal, and lateral temporal regions. In 69 (35 females, mean age ± SD = 33.6 ± 18.0 years) patients who underwent surgery, LRMs based on network‐identified GM regions predicted postsurgical verbal memory worsening with a receiver operating curve area under the curve of 0.70 ± 0.15.
            
            
              Interpretation
              A differential pattern of GM thickness can be found across different cognitive phenotypes in TLE. Including magnetic resonance imaging with clinical measures associated with cognitive profiles has potential in predicting postsurgical cognitive outcomes in drug‐resistant},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Accurate prediction of seizure occurrence has long been a clinical goal since this would allow to optimize patient treatment, prevent injuries due to seizures, and alleviate the patient burden of unpredictability. Advances in implantable electroencephalographic (EEG) devices, allowing for long-term interictal EEG recordings, have facilitated major progress in this field. Recently, it has been discovered that interictal brain activity demonstrates circadian and multi-dien cycles that are strongly aligned, or phase locked, with seizure risk. Thus, cyclical brain activity patterns have been used to forecast seizures. However, in the effort to develop a clinically useful EEG based seizure forecasting system, challenges remain. Firstly, multiple EEG features demonstrate cyclical patterns, but it remains unclear which feature is best suited for predicting seizures. Secondly, the technology for long-term EEG recording is currently limited in both spatial and temporal sampling resolution. In this study, we compare five established EEG metrics:synchrony, spatial correlation, temporal correlation, signal variance which have been motivated from critical dynamics theory, and interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) which are a traditional marker of seizure propensity. We assess their effectiveness in detecting 24-h and seizure cycles as well as their robustness under spatial and temporal subsampling. Analyzing intracranial EEG data from 23 patients, we report that all examined features exhibit 24-h cycles. Spatial correlation, signal variance, and synchrony showed the highest phase locking with seizures, while IED rates were the lowest. Notably, spatial and temporal correlation were also found to be highly correlated to each other, as were signal variance and IED—suggesting some features may reflect similar aspects of cortical dynamics, whereas others provide complementary information. All features proved robust under subsampling, indicating that the dynamic properties of interictal activity evolve slowly and are not confined to specific brain regions. Our results may aid future translational research by assisting in design and testing of EEG based seizure forecasting systems.},

	abstract = {The brain criticality hypothesis postulates that brain dynamics are set at a phase transition where information processing is optimized. Long-range temporal correlations (TCs) characterizing the dissipation of information within a signal have been shown to be a hallmark of brain criticality. However, the experimental link between cognitive performance, criticality and thus TCs has remained elusive due to limitations in recording length, and spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we investigate multi-day invasive EEG recordings of 104 persons with epilepsy together with an extensive cognitive test battery. We show that short TCs predict cognitive impairment. Further, we show that heterogeneous factors, including interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), antiseizure medications (ASMs) and intermittent periods with slow-wave activity (SWSs), all act directly to perturb critical dynamics and thus cognition. Our work suggests critical dynamics to be the setpoint to measure optimal network function, thereby providing a unifying framework for the heterogeneous mechanisms impacting cognition in conditions like epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy may benefit from ablative or resective surgery. In presurgical work-up, intracranial EEG markers have been shown to be useful in identification of the seizure onset zone and prediction of post-surgical seizure freedom. However, in most cases, implantation of depth or subdural electrodes is performed, exposing patients to increased risks of complications. Methods: We analysed EEG data recorded from a minimally invasive approach utilizing foramen ovale (FO) and epidural peg electrodes using a supervised machine learning approach to predict post-surgical seizure freedom. Power-spectral EEG features were incorporated in a logistic regression model predicting one-year post-surgical seizure freedom. The prediction model was validated using repeated 5-fold cross-validation and compared to outcome prediction based on clinical and scalp EEG variables. Results: Forty-seven patients (26 patients with post-surgical 1-year seizure freedom) were included in the study, with 31 having FO and 27 patients having peg onset seizures. The area under the receiver-operating curve for post-surgical seizure freedom (Engel 1A) prediction in patients with FO onset seizures was 0.74 ± 0.23 using electrophysiology features, compared to 0.66 ± 0.22 for predictions based on clinical and scalp EEG variables (p {\textless} 0.001). The most important features for prediction were spectral power in the gamma and high gamma ranges. EEG data from peg electrodes was not informative in predicting post-surgical outcomes. Conclusion: In this hypothesis-generating study, a data-driven approach based on EEG features derived from FO electrodes recordings outperformed the predictive ability based solely on clinical and scalp EEG variables. Pending validation in future studies, this method may provide valuable post-surgical prognostic information while minimizing risks of more invasive diagnostic approaches.},

	abstract = {The ability of neural circuits to integrate information over time and across different cortical areas is believed an essential ingredient for information processing in the brain. Temporal and spatial correlations in cortex dynamics have independently been shown to capture these integration properties in task-dependent ways. A fundamental question remains if temporal and spatial integration properties are linked and what internal and external factors shape these correlations. Previous research on spatio-temporal correlations has been limited in duration and coverage, thus providing only an incomplete picture of their interdependence and variability. Here, we use long-term invasive EEG data to comprehensively map temporal and spatial correlations according to cortical topography, vigilance state and drug dependence over extended periods of time. We show that temporal and spatial correlations in cortical networks are intimately linked, decline under antiepileptic drug action, and break down during slow-wave sleep. Further, we report temporal correlations in human electrophysiology signals to increase with the functional hierarchy in cortex. Systematic investigation of a neural network model suggests that these dynamical features may arise when dynamics are poised near a critical point. Our results provide mechanistic and functional links between specific measurable changes in the network dynamics relevant for characterizing the brain’s changing information processing capabilities.},
