  abstract  = "Information processing in complex systems is often found to be
               maximally efficient close to critical states associated with
               phase transitions. It is therefore conceivable that also neural
               information processing operates close to criticality. This is
               further supported by the observation of power-law distributions,
               which are a hallmark of phase transitions. An important open
               question is how neural networks could remain close to a critical
               point while undergoing a continual change in the course of
               development, adaptation, learning, and more. An influential
               contribution was made by Bornholdt and Rohlf, introducing a
               generic mechanism of robust self-organized criticality in
               adaptive networks. Here, we address the question whether this
               mechanism is relevant for real neural networks. We show in a
               realistic model that spike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity
               can self-organize neural networks robustly toward criticality.
               Our model reproduces several empirical observations and makes
               testable predictions on the distribution of synaptic strength,
               relating them to the critical state of the network. These
               results suggest that the interplay between dynamics and topology
               may be essential for neural information processing.",

  abstract  = "The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proto-oncogenic protein is a
               histone-lysine N-methyltransferase that is produced by
               proteolytic cleavage and self-association of the respective
               functionally distinct subunits (MLL(N) and MLL(C)) to form a
               holocomplex involved in epigenetic transcriptional regulation.
               On the basis of studies in Drosophila it has been suggested that
               the separated subunits might also have distinct functions. In
               this study, we used a genetically engineered mouse line that
               lacked MLL(C) to show that the MLL(N)-MLL(C) holocomplex is
               responsible for MLL functions in various developmental
               processes. The stability of MLL(N) is dependent on its
               intramolecular interaction with MLL(C), which is mediated
               through the first and fourth plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers
               (PHD1 and PHD4) and the phenylalanine/tyrosine-rich (FYRN)
               domain of MLL(N). Free MLL(N) is destroyed by a mechanism that
               targets the FYRN domain, whereas free MLL(C) is exported to the
               cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome. PHD1 is encoded by an
               alternatively spliced exon that is occasionally deleted in
               T-cell leukemia, and its absence produces an MLL mutant protein
               that is deficient for holocomplex formation. Therefore, this
               should be a loss-of-function mutant allele, suggesting that the
               known tumor suppression role of MLL may also apply to the T-cell
               lineage. Our data demonstrate that the dissociated MLL subunits
               are subjected to distinct degradation pathways and thus not
               likely to have separate functions unless the degradation
               mechanisms are inhibited.",

               activity patterns following power-law distributions, a hallmark
               of systems at a critical state, have led to the hypothesis that
               human brain dynamics could be poised at a phase transition

  abstract  = "Epileptic seizures are one of the most well-known dysfunctions
               of the nervous system. During a seizure, a highly synchronized
               behavior of neural activity is observed that can cause symptoms
               ranging from mild sensual malfunctions to the complete loss of
               body control. In this paper, we aim to contribute towards a
               better understanding of the dynamical systems phenomena that
               cause seizures. Based on data analysis and modelling, seizure
               dynamics can be identified to possess multiple spatial scales
               and on each spatial scale also multiple time scales. At each
               scale, we reach several novel insights. On the smallest spatial
               scale we consider single model neurons and investigate
               early-warning signs of spiking. This introduces the theory of
               critical transitions to excitable systems. For clusters of
               neurons (or neuronal regions) we use patient data and find
               oscillatory behavior and new scaling laws near the seizure
               onset. These scalings lead to substantiate the conjecture
               obtained from mean-field models that a Hopf bifurcation could be
               involved near seizure onset. On the largest spatial scale we
               introduce a measure based on phase-locking intervals and
               wavelets into seizure modelling. It is used to resolve
               synchronization between different regions in the brain and
               identifies time-shifted scaling laws at different wavelet
               scales. We also compare our wavelet-based multiscale approach

               sleep optimal brain functioning such as responsiveness to
               stimuli, information processing, or learning may be impaired.
               Such observations suggest that sleep plays a crucial role in
               organizing or reorganizing neuronal networks of the brain toward
               states where information processing is optimized. Increasing
               evidence suggests that cortical neuronal networks operate near a
               critical state characterized by balanced activity patterns,
               which supports optimal information processing. However, it
               remains unknown whether critical dynamics is affected in the
               course of wake and sleep, which would also impact information
               processing. Here, we show that signatures of criticality are
               progressively disturbed during wake and restored by sleep. We
               demonstrate that the precise power-laws governing the cascading
               activity of neuronal avalanches and the distribution of
               phase-lock intervals in human electroencephalographic recordings
               are increasingly disarranged during sustained wakefulness. These
               changes are accompanied by a decrease in variability of
               synchronization. Interpreted in the context of a critical
               branching process, these seemingly different findings indicate a
               decline of balanced activity and progressive distance from
               criticality toward states characterized by an imbalance toward
               excitation where larger events prevail dynamics. Conversely,
               sleep restores the critical state resulting in recovered
               power-law characteristics in activity and variability of
               synchronization. These findings support the intriguing
               hypothesis that sleep may be important to reorganize cortical

  abstract  = "Many complex systems have been found to exhibit critical
               transitions, or so-called tipping points, which are sudden
               changes to a qualitatively different system state. These changes
               can profoundly impact the functioning of a system ranging from
               controlled state switching to a catastrophic break-down; signals
               that predict critical transitions are therefore highly
               desirable. To this end, research efforts have focused on
               utilizing qualitative changes in markers related to a system's
               tendency to recover more slowly from a perturbation the closer
               it gets to the transition--a phenomenon called critical slowing
               down. The recently studied scaling of critical slowing down
               offers a refined path to understand critical transitions: to
               identify the transition mechanism and improve transition
               prediction using scaling laws. Here, we outline and apply this
               strategy for the first time in a real-world system by studying
               the transition to spiking in neurons of the mammalian cortex.
               The dynamical system approach has identified two robust
               mechanisms for the transition from subthreshold activity to
               spiking, saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation. Although theory
               provides precise predictions on signatures of critical slowing
               down near the bifurcation to spiking, quantitative experimental
               evidence has been lacking. Using whole-cell patch-clamp
               recordings from pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking interneurons,
               we show that 1) the transition to spiking dynamically
               corresponds to a critical transition exhibiting slowing down, 2)
               the scaling laws suggest a saddle-node bifurcation governing
               slowing down, and 3) these precise scaling laws can be used to
               predict the bifurcation point from a limited window of
               observation. To our knowledge this is the first report of
               scaling laws of critical slowing down in an experiment. They
               present a missing link for a broad class of neuroscience
               modeling and suggest improved estimation of tipping points by
               incorporating scaling laws of critical slowing down as a
               strategy applicable to other complex systems.",
