  abstract  = "Information processing in complex systems is often found to be
               maximally efficient close to critical states associated with
               phase transitions. It is therefore conceivable that also neural
               information processing operates close to criticality. This is
               further supported by the observation of power-law distributions,
               which are a hallmark of phase transitions. An important open
               question is how neural networks could remain close to a critical
               point while undergoing a continual change in the course of
               development, adaptation, learning, and more. An influential
               contribution was made by Bornholdt and Rohlf, introducing a
               generic mechanism of robust self-organized criticality in
               adaptive networks. Here, we address the question whether this
               mechanism is relevant for real neural networks. We show in a
               realistic model that spike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity
               can self-organize neural networks robustly toward criticality.
               Our model reproduces several empirical observations and makes
               testable predictions on the distribution of synaptic strength,
               relating them to the critical state of the network. These
               results suggest that the interplay between dynamics and topology
               may be essential for neural information processing.",

  abstract  = "The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proto-oncogenic protein is a
               histone-lysine N-methyltransferase that is produced by
               proteolytic cleavage and self-association of the respective
               functionally distinct subunits (MLL(N) and MLL(C)) to form a
               holocomplex involved in epigenetic transcriptional regulation.
               On the basis of studies in Drosophila it has been suggested that
               the separated subunits might also have distinct functions. In
               this study, we used a genetically engineered mouse line that
               lacked MLL(C) to show that the MLL(N)-MLL(C) holocomplex is
               responsible for MLL functions in various developmental
               processes. The stability of MLL(N) is dependent on its
               intramolecular interaction with MLL(C), which is mediated
               through the first and fourth plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers
               (PHD1 and PHD4) and the phenylalanine/tyrosine-rich (FYRN)
               domain of MLL(N). Free MLL(N) is destroyed by a mechanism that
               targets the FYRN domain, whereas free MLL(C) is exported to the
               cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome. PHD1 is encoded by an
               alternatively spliced exon that is occasionally deleted in
               T-cell leukemia, and its absence produces an MLL mutant protein
               that is deficient for holocomplex formation. Therefore, this
               should be a loss-of-function mutant allele, suggesting that the
               known tumor suppression role of MLL may also apply to the T-cell
               lineage. Our data demonstrate that the dissociated MLL subunits
               are subjected to distinct degradation pathways and thus not
               likely to have separate functions unless the degradation
               mechanisms are inhibited.",

               of the nervous system. During a seizure, a highly synchronized
               behavior of neural activity is observed that can cause symptoms
               ranging from mild sensual malfunctions to the complete loss of
               body control. In this paper, we aim to contribute towards a
               better understanding of the dynamical systems phenomena that
               cause seizures. Based on data analysis and modelling, seizure
               dynamics can be identified to possess multiple spatial scales
               and on each spatial scale also multiple time scales. At each
               scale, we reach several novel insights. On the smallest spatial
               scale we consider single model neurons and investigate
               early-warning signs of spiking. This introduces the theory of
               critical transitions to excitable systems. For clusters of
               neurons (or neuronal regions) we use patient data and find
               oscillatory behavior and new scaling laws near the seizure
               onset. These scalings lead to substantiate the conjecture
               obtained from mean-field models that a Hopf bifurcation could be
               involved near seizure onset. On the largest spatial scale we
               introduce a measure based on phase-locking intervals and

               sleep optimal brain functioning such as responsiveness to
               stimuli, information processing, or learning may be impaired.
               Such observations suggest that sleep plays a crucial role in
               organizing or reorganizing neuronal networks of the brain toward
               states where information processing is optimized. Increasing
               evidence suggests that cortical neuronal networks operate near a
               critical state characterized by balanced activity patterns,
               which supports optimal information processing. However, it
               remains unknown whether critical dynamics is affected in the
               course of wake and sleep, which would also impact information
               processing. Here, we show that signatures of criticality are
               progressively disturbed during wake and restored by sleep. We
               demonstrate that the precise power-laws governing the cascading
               activity of neuronal avalanches and the distribution of
               phase-lock intervals in human electroencephalographic recordings

               branching process, these seemingly different findings indicate a
               decline of balanced activity and progressive distance from
               criticality toward states characterized by an imbalance toward
               excitation where larger events prevail dynamics. Conversely,

               power-law characteristics in activity and variability of

In epilepsy, robust diagnostics applicable to the ambulatory setting are needed as diagnosis and treatment decisions in current clinical practice are primarily reliant on patient self-reports, which are often inaccurate. Recent work using wearable devices has focused on methods to detect and forecast epileptic seizures. Whether wearable device signals may also contain information about the effect of antiseizure medications (ASMs), which may ultimately help to better monitor their efficacy, has not been evaluated yet. Here we systematically investigated the effect of ASMs on different data modalities (electrodermal activity, EDA, heart rate, HR, and heart rate variability, HRV) simultaneously recorded by a wearable device in 48 patients with epilepsy over several days in the epilepsy long-term monitoring unit at a tertiary hospital. All signals exhibited characteristic diurnal variations. HRV, but not HR or EDA-based metrics, were reduced by ASMs. By assessing multiple signals related to the autonomic nervous system simultaneously, our results provide novel insights into the effects of ASMs on the sympathetic and parasympathetic interplay in the setting of epilepsy and indicate the potential of easy-to-wear wearable devices for monitoring ASM action. Future work using longer data may investigate these metrics on multidien cycles and their utility for detecting seizures, assessing seizure risk, or informing treatment interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective: Objective seizure count estimates are crucial for ambulatory epilepsy management. Wearables have shown promise for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures but may suffer from false alarms and undetected seizures. Seizure signatures recorded by wearables often occur over prolonged periods, including increased levels of electrodermal activity and heart rate long after seizure EEG onset, however, previous detection methods only partially exploited these signatures. Understanding the utility of these prolonged signatures for seizure count estimation and what factors generally determine seizure logging performance, including the role of data quality vs. algorithm performance, is thus crucial for improving wearables-based epilepsy monitoring and determining which patients benefit most from this technology.

Methods: In this retrospective study we examined 76 pediatric epilepsy patients during multiday video-EEG monitoring equipped with a wearable (Empatica E4; records of electrodermal activity, EDA, accelerometry, ACC, heart rate, HR; 1983 h total recording time; 45 tonic-clonic seizures). To log seizures on prolonged data trends, we applied deep learning on continuous overlapping 1-hour segments of multimodal data in a leave-one-subject-out approach. We systematically examined factors influencing logging performance, including patient age, antiseizure medication (ASM) load, seizure type and duration, and data artifacts. To gain insights into algorithm function and feature importance we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP, to represent the separability of learned features) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP, to represent the most informative data signatures).

Results: Performance for tonic-clonic seizure logging increased systematically with patient age (AUC 0.61 for patients 〈 11 years, AUC 0.77 for patients between 11-15 years, AUC 0.85 for patients 〉 15 years). Across all ages, AUC was 0.75 corresponding to a sensitivity of 0.52 and a false alarm rate of 0.28/24 h. Seizures under high ASM load or with shorter duration were detected worse (P=.025, P=.033, respectively). UMAP visualized discriminatory power at the individual patient level, SHAP analyses identified clonic motor activity and peri/postictal increases in HR and EDA as most informative. In contrast, in missed seizures, these features were absent indicating that recording quality but not the algorithm caused the low sensitivity in these patients.

Significance: Our results demonstrate the utility of prolonged, postictal data segments for seizure logging, contribute to algorithm explainability and point to influencing factors, including high ASM dose and short seizure duration. Collectively, these results may help to identify patients who particularly benefit from such technology.},

                ‐statistics from comparisons of GM regions within each TLE cognitive phenotype and age‐ and sex‐matched healthy participants.

              Results
              A total of 124 patients (63 females, mean age ± standard deviation [SD] = 36.0 ± 12.0 years) and 117 healthy controls (63 females, mean age ± SD = 36.1 ± 12.0 years) were analyzed. In the multidomain CI group (n = 66, 53.2\%), 28 GM regions were significantly thinner compared to healthy controls. Focally impaired patients (n = 37, 29.8\%) showed 13 regions, whereas minimally impaired patients (n = 21, 16.9\%) had 2 significantly thinner GM regions. Regions affected in both multidomain and focally impaired patients included the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal, and lateral temporal regions. In 69 (35 females, mean age ± SD = 33.6 ± 18.0 years) patients who underwent surgery, LRMs based on network‐identified GM regions predicted postsurgical verbal memory worsening with a receiver operating curve area under the curve of 0.70 ± 0.15.

	abstract = {Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Accurate prediction of seizure occurrence has long been a clinical goal since this would allow to optimize patient treatment, prevent injuries due to seizures, and alleviate the patient burden of unpredictability. Advances in implantable electroencephalographic (EEG) devices, allowing for long-term interictal EEG recordings, have facilitated major progress in this field. Recently, it has been discovered that interictal brain activity demonstrates circadian and multi-dien cycles that are strongly aligned, or phase locked, with seizure risk. Thus, cyclical brain activity patterns have been used to forecast seizures. However, in the effort to develop a clinically useful EEG based seizure forecasting system, challenges remain. Firstly, multiple EEG features demonstrate cyclical patterns, but it remains unclear which feature is best suited for predicting seizures. Secondly, the technology for long-term EEG recording is currently limited in both spatial and temporal sampling resolution. In this study, we compare five established EEG metrics:synchrony, spatial correlation, temporal correlation, signal variance which have been motivated from critical dynamics theory, and interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) which are a traditional marker of seizure propensity. We assess their effectiveness in detecting 24-h and seizure cycles as well as their robustness under spatial and temporal subsampling. Analyzing intracranial EEG data from 23 patients, we report that all examined features exhibit 24-h cycles. Spatial correlation, signal variance, and synchrony showed the highest phase locking with seizures, while IED rates were the lowest. Notably, spatial and temporal correlation were also found to be highly correlated to each other, as were signal variance and IED—suggesting some features may reflect similar aspects of cortical dynamics, whereas others provide complementary information. All features proved robust under subsampling, indicating that the dynamic properties of interictal activity evolve slowly and are not confined to specific brain regions. Our results may aid future translational research by assisting in design and testing of EEG based seizure forecasting systems.},

	abstract = {The brain criticality hypothesis postulates that brain dynamics are set at a phase transition where information processing is optimized. Long-range temporal correlations (TCs) characterizing the dissipation of information within a signal have been shown to be a hallmark of brain criticality. However, the experimental link between cognitive performance, criticality and thus TCs has remained elusive due to limitations in recording length, and spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we investigate multi-day invasive EEG recordings of 104 persons with epilepsy together with an extensive cognitive test battery. We show that short TCs predict cognitive impairment. Further, we show that heterogeneous factors, including interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), antiseizure medications (ASMs) and intermittent periods with slow-wave activity (SWSs), all act directly to perturb critical dynamics and thus cognition. Our work suggests critical dynamics to be the setpoint to measure optimal network function, thereby providing a unifying framework for the heterogeneous mechanisms impacting cognition in conditions like epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy may benefit from ablative or resective surgery. In presurgical work-up, intracranial EEG markers have been shown to be useful in identification of the seizure onset zone and prediction of post-surgical seizure freedom. However, in most cases, implantation of depth or subdural electrodes is performed, exposing patients to increased risks of complications. Methods: We analysed EEG data recorded from a minimally invasive approach utilizing foramen ovale (FO) and epidural peg electrodes using a supervised machine learning approach to predict post-surgical seizure freedom. Power-spectral EEG features were incorporated in a logistic regression model predicting one-year post-surgical seizure freedom. The prediction model was validated using repeated 5-fold cross-validation and compared to outcome prediction based on clinical and scalp EEG variables. Results: Forty-seven patients (26 patients with post-surgical 1-year seizure freedom) were included in the study, with 31 having FO and 27 patients having peg onset seizures. The area under the receiver-operating curve for post-surgical seizure freedom (Engel 1A) prediction in patients with FO onset seizures was 0.74 ± 0.23 using electrophysiology features, compared to 0.66 ± 0.22 for predictions based on clinical and scalp EEG variables (p {\textless} 0.001). The most important features for prediction were spectral power in the gamma and high gamma ranges. EEG data from peg electrodes was not informative in predicting post-surgical outcomes. Conclusion: In this hypothesis-generating study, a data-driven approach based on EEG features derived from FO electrodes recordings outperformed the predictive ability based solely on clinical and scalp EEG variables. Pending validation in future studies, this method may provide valuable post-surgical prognostic information while minimizing risks of more invasive diagnostic approaches.},

	abstract = {The ability of neural circuits to integrate information over time and across different cortical areas is believed an essential ingredient for information processing in the brain. Temporal and spatial correlations in cortex dynamics have independently been shown to capture these integration properties in task-dependent ways. A fundamental question remains if temporal and spatial integration properties are linked and what internal and external factors shape these correlations. Previous research on spatio-temporal correlations has been limited in duration and coverage, thus providing only an incomplete picture of their interdependence and variability. Here, we use long-term invasive EEG data to comprehensively map temporal and spatial correlations according to cortical topography, vigilance state and drug dependence over extended periods of time. We show that temporal and spatial correlations in cortical networks are intimately linked, decline under antiepileptic drug action, and break down during slow-wave sleep. Further, we report temporal correlations in human electrophysiology signals to increase with the functional hierarchy in cortex. Systematic investigation of a neural network model suggests that these dynamical features may arise when dynamics are poised near a critical point. Our results provide mechanistic and functional links between specific measurable changes in the network dynamics relevant for characterizing the brain’s changing information processing capabilities.},

This includes a description of the interactions between the CNS and the ANS, including physiological and epilepsy‐related changes affecting their dynamics. We first discuss technical aspects of measuring autonomic biosignals and considerations for using ANS sensors in clinical practice. We then review recent seizure detection and seizure forecasting studies, highlighting their performance and capability for seizure detection and forecasting using devices measuring ANS biomarkers. Finally, we address the field's challenges and provide an outlook for future developments.},

              Background
              Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a preventable determinant for poor outcome after stroke. Machine learning (ML) using large-scale clinical data warehouses may be able to predict SAP and identify patients for targeted interventions. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for identifying clinically apparent SAP using automated ML.
            
            
              Methods
              The ML model used clinical and laboratory parameters along with heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure (BP) values obtained during the first 48 h after stroke unit admission. A logistic regression classifier was developed and internally validated with a nested-cross-validation (nCV) approach. For every shuffle, the model was first trained and validated with a fixed threshold for 0.9 sensitivity, then finally tested on the out-of-sample data and benchmarked against a widely validated clinical score (A2DS2).
            
            
              Results
              
                We identified 2390 eligible patients admitted to two-stroke units at Charité between October 2020 and June 2023, of whom 1755 had all parameters available. SAP was diagnosed in 96/1755 (5.5\%). Circadian profiles in HR, HRV, and BP metrics during the first 48 h after admission exhibited distinct differences between patients with SAP diagnosis vs. those without. CRP, mRS at admission, leukocyte count, high-frequency power in HRV, stroke severity at admission, sex, and diastolic BP were identified as the most informative ML features. We obtained an AUC of 0.91 (CI 0.88–0.95) for the ML model on the out-of-sample data in comparison to an AUC of 0.84 (CI 0.76–0.91) for the previously established A2DS2 score (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001). The ML model provided a sensitivity of 0.87 (CI 0.75–0.97) with a corresponding specificity of 0.82 (CI 0.78–0.85) which outperformed the A2DS2 score for multiple cutoffs.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Automated, data warehouse-based prediction of clinically apparent SAP in the stroke unit setting is feasible, benefits from the inclusion of vital signs, and could be useful for identifying high-risk patients or prophylactic pneumonia management in clinical routine.},

We used data lake-enabled continuous electrocardiograms to assess post-stroke HR and HRV, and to determine the utility of HR and HRV to improve machine learning-based predictions of stroke outcome.
            
            
              Methods
              In this observational cohort study, we included stroke patients admitted to two stroke units in Berlin, Germany, between October 2020 and December 2021 with final diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or acute intracranial hemorrhage and collected continuous ECG data through data warehousing. We created circadian profiles of several continuously recorded ECG parameters including HR and HRV parameters. The pre-defined primary outcome was short-term unfavorable functional outcome after stroke indicated through modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of {\textgreater} 2.
            
            
              Results
              
                We included 625 stroke patients, 287 stroke patients remained after matching for age and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; mean age 74.5 years, 45.6\% female, 88.9\% ischemic, median NIHSS 5). Both higher HR and nocturnal non-dipping of HR were associated with unfavorable functional outcome (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.01). The examined HRV parameters were not associated with the outcome of interest. Nocturnal non-dipping of HR ranked highly in feature importance of various machine learning models.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our data suggest that a lack of circadian HR modulation, specifically nocturnal non-dipping, is associated with short-term unfavorable functional outcome after stroke, and that including HR into machine learning-based prediction models may lead to improved stroke outcome prediction.},

            Abstract
            In Germany, long-term video EEG as the gold standard for the diagnostics of epilepsy and other seizure disorders, is currently only available for inpatient monitoring in a limited number of specialized centers. These limited monitoring capacities and the large amount of associated time and work resources lead to a significant waiting time for this important diagnostic procedure nationwide. New portable sensor technology and automated data analysis methods are creating opportunities for gold standard long-term video EEG assessments in outpatient settings, which may help to resolve this barrier. Here, we report the results of a single-center feasibility study by implementing outpatient long-term video EEG (ALVEEG) as a diagnostic pathway in Germany. In the new diagnostic pathway, the use of innovative, portable video EEG monitoring systems along with artificial intelligence-assisted data analysis are intended to provide those patients affected by seizure disorders with a more rapid, efficient, and cross-sectoral access to gold standard diagnostics in the home environment. The diagnostics were well accepted by patients and clinicians and may represent a complementary option to inpatient monitoring to eliminate current bottlenecks in diagnostics and care.},

            Despite its complexity, whole-brain neural activity spontaneously organizes into a limited range of states, indicating that a low-dimensional representation or embedding might be sufficient to capture much of its macroscale dynamics. Clinical practice makes use of this notion by classifying EEG into discrete states, for example in the wake-sleep cycle or along the ictal-interictal continuum. Such classification into distinct classes has clinical value and simplifies EEG interpretation (by humans and, more recently, also by artificial intelligence [AI]) but misses subtle differences, mixtures and transitions between states. In other words, it does not adequately reflect the true underlying, low-dimensional continuum of states. The lack of a continuum EEG map limits more realistic characterizations of EEG states and challenges prognostication in patients with disorders of consciousness due to their diverse patterns, etiologies and underlying pathophysiologies. We here use data across the health-disease continuum (wake [W], sleep [REM, N1, N2, N3], ictal-interictal-continuum [lateralized and generalized periodic discharges (LPD, GPD), lateralized and generalized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, GRDA)], seizures [SZ], burst suppression [BS]; 20,043 patients, 288,986 EEG segments) and a deep neural network that optimises a low-dimensional embedding space. This universal map of EEG (UM-EEG) is highly semantic, confined and captures meaningful distances as well as transitions between EEG states. Classification and clustering of unseen EEG are easily implemented using standard techniques on the map that match performance of current AI algorithms while extending it to the currently largest set of classes across the full health-disease continuum (mean AUROCs and 95\% CI one-vs-all classification: W 0.94 [0.94, 0.95], N1 0.85 [0.85, 0.86], REM 0.92 [0.91, 0.92], N2 0.91 [0.90, 0.91], N3 0.98 [0.97, 0.98], GRDA [0.97 [0.96, 0.97], LRDA 0.97 [0.96, 0.97], SZ 0.87 [0.83, 0.91], GPD 0.99 [0.98, 0.90], LPD 0.97 [0.97, 0.97)], BS 0.94 [0.93, 0.94]). Long-term EEGs are represented as trajectories in this continuous embedding space which predict outcome (recovery or death) after cardiac arrest with an AUROC of 0.86 (
            N
            = 575 patients). For these patients, the map identifies interpretable factors governing prognosis: the distance to healthy states, the variability of state transitions, and time spent in burst suppression. These factors allow personalized monitoring and comparison of patients to themselves over time. In conclusion, UM-EEG presents a novel, comprehensive and physiologically meaningful representation to characterize and classify brain states along the health-disease continuum. It demonstrates immediate clinical utility by enhancing current diagnostic and prognostic capabilities.},
